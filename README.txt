Easily add a table of contents to your multi part posts. Automated syncing cross-posts. Quick and easy to setup.

== Description ==

Multi Part Posts allows you to easily configure and organize posts with multiple parts, eg. "My Awesome Blog Part 1", "...Part 2", etc... by introducing a table of contents to the top of your post.

####How to use
Installing the plugin creates a new metabox on your edit post screen that allows you to group your posts together. It's straightforward and no nonsense.

####Configuration
For v1.0.0 there are no GUI based configuration options except the post grouping itself. For more advanced users, you can checkout the available filters and actions [on github](https://github.com/nathanmarks/wordpress-multi-part-posts). In later versions I plan on introducing some GUI based customization and settings.

####Styling
The markup created by the plugin should fit right into your current theme, if not the markup is very clean and easy to write custom styles for.
